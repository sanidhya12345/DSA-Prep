Given list of processes where each value representing memory consuption 
by the process and given one variable m representing number of processes
to be removed. We need to delete m number of processes from the list in 
contiguous manner and return minimum amount of main memory used by all 
the proccesses running after deleting contiguous segment of processes.

 

Example - processes = {10,4,8,13,20}, m = 2;
output = 22 [removing 13 and 20 as its consuming large memory]
