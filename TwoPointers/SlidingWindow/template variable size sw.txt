Template of variable size sliding window 

In variable size  s.w  :- take care of 3 cases :-  
i) if curr_condn < k  :---- j++ 
ii) if curr_condn == k then generally, find :-    ans ðŸ¡¨ calc.  & then again j++.
iii)If curr_condn > k then will remove elements from the left of window until curr_condn again starts satisfying the given condn or < given condn. 

Patterns Problems of variable size sliding window.

a) On the basis of what we have to find, I have divided the problems into 3 types :- 
Count subarr / substr.     ðŸ¡¨ imp.
Longest subarr. / substr.
Shortest subarr. / substr.

b) On the basis of given Condn K, I have again divided the problems into 3 types:- 
Atmost K
Exactly K
Atleast K
