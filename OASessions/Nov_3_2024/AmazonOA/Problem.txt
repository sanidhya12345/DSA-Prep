You are given a string of even length .You can remove any 2 chars from the string
There are certain cost of removing those chars:
1.if you remove 2 same chars then the cost will be x.
2.if you remove 2 diff chars then the cost will be y.

Solution:
there are certain cases which we have to solve to solve the actual problem

1.if x==y then you can remove any chars and cost will not affected either removing the same or diff chars
    ans=n/2*x;
2. else if x<y which means the cost of removing the same chars are less than the cost of removing the diff chars for that 
we will just count the odd freq chars from the hashmap
then answer will be:
  let suppose the count of odd freq chars will be c1;  
  remaining chars=total lenght of the string - c1;
  ans=c1/2*x+(remaining chars/2)*y
 
3.for x>y which measn the cost of removing the same chars will be more than the cost of removing the diff chars.

   create a priority queue for this and put all the frequencies of the chars in the pq/]
   Basically we have to create a maximum heap of the frequencies
   select two large freq values and decrease the couunt of them if count>0 then again put them into the hashmap.
   and cost of doing this operation is y after this there are certain elements with even frequency may or may not be left so their removal cost wil be x.
   
   let suppoose that the count of all operations is c0;
   then answer will be:
   ans=c0*y+(remainder left/2)*x
